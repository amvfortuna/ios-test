# Summary of what's inside the code

- Pure SwiftUI app
- Simple MVVM architecture
- Unit testing with Swift Testing
- Dependency Injection with Swinject
- SPM for managing dependencies (Swinject and PullToRefreshSwiftUI)

## Requirements

- Xcode 26.2
- iOS 17.6 and up

## How to run
Simply clone the project, open up Xcode, and run!

#### Note
This project runs just fine with iOS 26, but there's a relatively minor UI issue related to Liquid Glass: selecting an item in the list view will briefly make the top of the page translucent while transitioning to the details view, which is slightly annoying but it doesn't affect the functionality so I decided to leave it at that at the interest of time.

## How many hours did I spend on this project
I started development around midday yesterday (14 Jan 2025) and finished tonight (15 Jan 2025), spending approximately 12 hours of development.

While the app itself is simple, I wanted to take this opportunity to use some of the newer technologies introduced in iOS, which adds to the development time as I was learning on the go. Overall, I had fun doing this project as I was able to play around with stuff I've never used before :)
