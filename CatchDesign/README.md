# Summary of what's inside the code

- Pure SwiftUI app
- Simple MVVM architecture
- Unit testing with Swift Testing
- Dependency Injection with Swinject
- SPM for managing dependencies (Swinject and PullToRefreshSwiftUI)

## Requirements

- Xcode 26.2
- iOS 17.6 and up

## How to run
Simply clone the project, open up Xcode, and run!

#### Note
This project runs just fine with iOS 26, but there's a relatively minor UI issue related to Liquid Glass: selecting an item in the list view will briefly make the top of the page translucent while transitioning to the details view, which is slightly annoying but it doesn't affect the functionality so I decided to leave it at that at the interest of time.
